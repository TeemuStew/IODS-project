# About the project

I first saw this course listed in the transferable skills course list for my doctoral program. The course looked interesting and useful, so I decided to register.

As I have no previous experience in R, RStudio or GitHub, I'm looking forward to first learning to use these tools properly. Then, I expect to use the tools to do data analysis and visualization, as well as to learn more about open data and open science.
